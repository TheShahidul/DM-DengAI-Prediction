# DM-DengAI-Prediction
Forecast weekly dengue cases in 2 cities using climate data, ensemble stacking, and negative binomial regression and the output is significantly better than the original. (I have implemented this Data Mining Lab as a project inspired by the DrivenData DengAI competition and find out new result.)
